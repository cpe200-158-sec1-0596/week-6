# Lab601: Identify the design pattern and participants from the program (group of 2 students)

In this lab, each group of 2 students has to identify a design pattern and all participants 
from the provided C# source code. 

## Submission: a written report which contains

1. A class diagram of the original source code

2. Detail explaination about the identified pattern and all the parcipants
Answer: This code have abstract factory pattern that encapsulated a group of factories without specifying their concrete classes.
3. Explain how to include "an asian herbivore and an asian carnivore" to the program: 
  - Show the class diagram of the program after including the new requirment.

  - Show the main function and snippet of C# code that is related to the process.
  ```cs
  public static void Main()
  {
    ContinentFactory africa = new AfricaFactory();
    AnimalWorld world = new AnimalWorld(africa);
    world.RunFoodChain();
 
    ContinentFactory america = new AmericaFactory();
    world = new AnimalWorld(america);
    world.RunFoodChain();

    ContinentFactory asia = new AsiaFactory();
    world = new AnimalWorld(asia);
    world.RunFoodChain();
 
    // Wait for user input
    Console.ReadKey();
  }

  class AsiaFactory : ContinentFactory
  {
    public override Herbivore CreateHerbivore()
    {
        return new Rabbit();
    }
    public override Carnivore CreateCarnivore()
    {
        return new Fox();
    }
  }
  class Rabbit : Herbivore
  {
  }
  class Fox : Carnivore
  {
    public override void Eat(Herbivore h)
    {
      Console.WriteLine(this.GetType().Name +
      " eats " + h.GetType().Name);
    }
  }
  ```
